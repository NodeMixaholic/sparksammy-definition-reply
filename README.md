# sparksammy-definition-reply
A reply that I felt I needed to make to Oklomsy's "sparksammy-definition". Mostly an open appology letter.

## Oklomsy, before you read this...
If we aren't going to be friends again, at the very least let's just stop this war going on in the background. I know you are gone, want to be left alone, and I am proud of what you have become. See here: https://sparksammy.com/oklomsy-truth/in-all-seriousness

## About that COSMOS thing/GEMS NT...
yeah. it was immature of me to expect that *you* who worked on the original GEMS project, could EVER learn a language much more easy that the source material. Ok but serious though: you didnt have to, and it was pretty unreasonable of me to expect you to work on it if you thought it was harder.

## The DDOS/Face situation.
I cannot express my sorrow enough for this situation. Oklomsy was giving me the cold shoulder, and him and his friend were asking "why lol why u do (*X*)" and when I explained why they ignored me so much that it antagonized me quite a bit. Now was it right of me to do that? No. It just wasn't. Also, I was in kinda a bad place mentally at the time. No excuses, just explanations.

## Me being a social manipulator....
It was true, I was manipulating Oklosmy without even realizing it. Now did I seem to care? No because I did NOT realize it. Was it right of me? Also no.

## Me leaking his proprietary code...
It was very wrong of me to leak ULIT. I have since set the repo to private and archived.

## About the beach thing...
Yeah your right. You deserved a break, I was just mad because you didn't tell me much of what was going on, if anything at all!

## About the arabfunny...
I still think arabfunny is funny, however if you find it offensive I shall not send it to you, I just got so used to sending it to you that I think I forgot how much you hated it at times. Also...

## Annoying !== Funny
Turns out annoying is not equal at all to funny. Probably just my zoomer humor coming out.

## Greif...
I am sorry for griefing your stuff. My dad did the same for my stuff, and I thought it was ok because I was mad with power. It wasn't.

## About the cloud thing...
Yeah, I removed you from my cloud, but that's just because I didn't trust you with admin powers, and I forgot how to demote people on GSuite. Plus I was too mad at you to figgure it out.

## However, there is one thing wrong about Oklomsy's definition...
I don't jabber about him everywhere I go, only to friends and certain of my friends I know I can trust.

## Oh and about the threatening letter you sent me in ALL CAPS.
You know the one. It was very unprofessional and honestly I hope you are joking, because I still want to talk to Mr. Z (You know who and you know what I am talking about.)
